# InstantMessaging
This is a 2 phase project that I built for practising networking in Java
Description of Project:
This project allows to send messages to a server and also receives from server
Server for this project was my personal computer ie localhost. But it can be used with a public server as well.
Once again the basic purpose of this project is to implement networking in Java.
It is a basic messenger that can implement additional features

USE:
Run the ServerTest class on your machine first. It will build a server and will wait for any client to connect with.
Now run ClientTest class while ServerTester is running. This will connect a client to the server
Once the connection is completed, you are all set to go and can start sharing text messages.
The connection can be stopped any time by entering END as a message in the chat box from any side
